  Performing Robots is an Interactive Media class that explores the world of experimental robots designed for theatrical performances. The class delves into questions about the significance of robotic performances, their emotional impact, and the artistic possibilities they unlock. This class encouraged us to create a new narrative where robots share the stage with humans, challenging conventional notions of performance. For this semester’s performance, the theme was robot ethics. 
	After careful consideration, the class settled on delivering the message through a play emulating reality TV, specifically inspired by Love Island. In this theatrical endeavor, each group was tasked with crafting a character and role for their robot, subsequently transitioning to the hands-on process of building the robot and ensuring it was fully equipped for its stage debut.
		For this project, I worked with Shaikha Al Nasri on our robot Emma-Lou. A farmer robot hailing from the southern region of Louisiana, aspires to attain human rights, given her diligent work ethic that matches, if not surpasses, that of human counterparts.

## Creating Emma-Lou
### September 25:
We had our base ready, equipped with two wheels on each side and two smaller wheels on the front and back for stability. The base initially seemed intimidating due to its size compared to the rest of the class's bases. Nevertheless, the professor encouraged us to persevere with the large base, suggesting that it might inspire us to think outside the box when crafting our final robot.

Challenges:
Ensuring the wheels on the side were securely connected and that the front and back wheels functioned effectively as stabilizers and anchors for the robot.

### October 4:
We obtained both the radio and remote control set, connected them, and ensured they were functioning.

### October 9:
During the class, we collaborated with study-away students from the Tel Aviv campus. To familiarize ourselves with robot construction and cardboard manipulation, we constructed a prototype performance robot from cardboard. Cardboard proved an optimal material for prototypes due to its lightweight nature and widespread availability. Utilizing cutting tools and a glue gun, we assembled a robot with a mouse-like appearance!

### October 12:
Played around with the Adafruit NeoPixel NeoMatrices 8x8 to get the hang of it since we knew we wanted to use it for our final robot’s eyes. 

#### Challenges:
Understanding how the NeoPixel matrices work and how to create shapes, like eyes, on them to convey emotions within their limited, structured format.

### October 16:
Shaikha and I successfully displayed various shapes in different colors on the NeoPixel matrix. We were also able to trigger audio with each shape change.

### November 6:
Acquired the wood to initiate the construction of our robot. Worked on implementing the NeoPixel eye concept and successfully made them operational.

#### Challenge:
As we opted for a robot resembling a scarecrow, we faced a dilemma in determining the level of accuracy we aimed for in representing a scarecrow. Our goal was to design a robot that achieved both accuracy and stability, while also incorporating enough movement to captivate the audience.

### November 7 & 8:
Deciding to accurately represent a scarecrow with our robot, we recognized that it would inherently lack movement. To offset this limitation, we chose to enhance Emma-Lou by adding a crow to her shoulder. The initial crow-building phase involved testing the mechanics of the servo motor in the neck and the one in the beak using cardboard pieces. Once we successfully integrated the servo motors, we proceeded to design and construct the crow body using scrunched-up paper bags, covered in aluminum foil and black air clay.

### November 9:	
We attached the scarecrow arm to the body and then drilled and secured the scarecrow to the base we constructed on September 25. Following that, we began constructing the crow's head and beak mechanism to ensure it both functioned properly and maintained the appearance of a crow.

### November 15:
We dressed Emma-Lou in a flannel shirt before affixing the crow to her shoulder/arm using both glue and string. Additionally, we added a cardboard shelf near her neck to securely mount the circuits and any other essential elements. We crafted facial features for her using colored paper, featuring a triangular nose and circular pink cheeks.

### November 20:
We completed the script and uploaded the cases onto the radio after coding them. Additionally, we selected an AI-generated voice from ElevenLabs to personify Emma-Lou. Visiting the textile studio, we obtained fabric for Emma-Lou's denim skirt, "cowboy" hat, and hay-like paper for her hands and neck to enhance the scarecrow appearance. We also covered the crow with black and purple feathers to achieve a more realistic look.

### December 10:
We extended the front and back wheels to enhance Emma-Lou's stability, preventing her from falling over. Additionally, we adjusted her speed to exert more control during rehearsals and the actual act.

### December 15:
Showcase day!
After many rehearsal sessions, Emma-Lou came together excellently and the show went incredibly well (:

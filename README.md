# PerformingRobots

### Play Idea
Concept:
Robots straying away from their expected/programmed “norms” and given orders to “demand” individuality and the liberty to do their own thing. Showcasing how human biases and actions can always seep into everything we create shedding light on the creator and object relationship.

Scene 1:
Robots being programmed by humans for a certain repetitive purpose. 

Scene 2:
Robots start to reject some orders they are given and “lazy” out instead; copying humans and demanding time off or individuality.

Scene 3:
Humans try to re-program robots to do their repetitive orders again and this time the robots reject every order fully.
